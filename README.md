# Coders of Delhi

A beginner-level data analysis project in pure Python (standard library only). Designed to process a JSON-based data dump and perform basic relational and structural analysis.

## Features

1. **Human-Readable Output**  
   Parses and converts raw JSON entries into coherent, meaningful sentences.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Removes redundant, malformed, or empty fields from the data dump to ensure consistency.

3. **People You May Know**  
   Suggests potential connections based on shared attributes or mutual links.

4. **People You Might Know**  
   Extends connection inference using indirect associations or latent patterns in data.

## Constraints

- No third-party libraries used, except the built-in `json` module.
- Built for educational and demonstrative purposes only.
- Not optimized for performance, scalability, or robustness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

```bash
python coders_of_delhi.py
